  <li>What is this site?</li>
  <ul>
    This is a site where you can paint places you have traveled around the world.<br>
    There were sites that could be painted by country,<br>
    I couldn't find a site that could be painted by the local government.<br>
    So I made it.<br>
    For example, if you travel only to Sakhalin, isn't it strange to fill that vast Russia?<br>
    This is the development motivation.<br>
  </ul>
